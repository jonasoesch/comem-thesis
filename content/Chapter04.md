# Marketing Mix
## Product
### Core Product

The problem of the clients is that there is not enough going on at comem+. This affects students motivation, promotion and general school culture in a negative way. The product tries to solve this problem on different levels. It unites the creative potential of students and gives the department a voice and with this a stronger identity. 

### Actual Product
The actual product is the podcast. It is the means to the end of the core product and serves its purpose. A podcast is a short (2 minutes) to medium (60 minutes) length audio programme which is delivered through the internet. The contents may vary greatly but are in line with students interests.

### Augmented Product
As the podcasts are produced in a secondary language, students enjoy the benefit of improved language skills. This language learning can be considered a service which adds value to the product. As there are students with different mother-tongues working together they profit from each others knowledge. Additionally there is always a language professor available for further help.

Additional values may be created by partnership with other organizations like the BALEINEV committee.



## Price
No money is demanded in exchange for the product. It demands however a certain amount of attention and time of the customer. By providing products and services which demand different levels of attention and engagement from the clients, the project tries to penetrate the market as much as possible.

Starting on the low end there are short shows on a variety of topics (like cooking or school culture) which range from two to ten minutes.

Upwards there are longer, more refined shows which treat topics more deeply.

For clients who want to get involved, the project offers ways to get in touch with the creators and discuss with them.

The highest level of possible engagement is the participation in the project. As it is open to about everyone, very motivated people are given the possibility to significantly influence the product.

In comparison to the concurrence we shoot at the same time lower and also higher when it comes to the demanded attention. Most podcast are longer than ten minutes. But also the maximum level of engagement is usually some kind of talk-back.

## Promotion
The main promotional element is word of mouth promotion. As many students come in contact with the project during their studies they automatically tell others about it. This is a free and very powerful promotional element and should work very well because the core market is small.

Social media helps with word of mouth promotion as people can easily share the project with their contacts or even discuss shows they liked with the ones who have created them.

To reach our extended market the project should consider partnerships with well-established enterprises and organizations with a certain reach in our extended market. On example would be the association of Swiss media engineers (VSMI/ASIM)[^36] which could help us to reach graduated media engineers.

## Place
The only distribution channel is the internet. This helps the project deliver broadcast at a very low cost and with global reach. Indirect sub channels are Soundcloud and iTunes. There is also a direct sub channel which is the projects website. This diversification in sub channels helps minimizing the risk of being cut off completely from the listeners.

## Physical Evidence
There is a very tangible part in the project, which are the podcasts. But as there are also quite a few service aspects to the project, it must consider some sort of physical evidence. For the language learning part, participants need to maintain a record of their tasks, achievements and problems. Based on this and the actual results they will receive a mark to represent the quality of their language learning efforts.

When it comes to the school marketing there is the projects website which also feeds the official department blog and will hopefully revive it a bit.

As for school culture, the project tries to provide a convivial environment inside of the CMC by providing sofas and other infrastructure for the students to dispose of.

## Partners
The project is completely built on partnerships inside and outside of the department. First of all, many of the participants are willing to share their prior knowledge and help others out. Examples for this may be some students helping others with the technical aspects of audio recording but also with difficulties in a secondary language. The participants therefore do also gain a lot from the project in terms of knowledge exchange and experience.

A very fertile partnership with professors and collaborators should help to push the project into the right direction as these partners bring in their experience and their farsightedness. These partners may hope to get access to the most motivated students and a very contemporary way of teaching. The ones who are ready to go out of their comfort zone, may also benefit from knowledge exchange.

Not to forget the school, which provides crucial financing and infrastructure. The school partners with (or better supports) the project as it may be a marketing instrument in the future.

To finish, there are also quite a few people who are willing to help out the students by participating in a show on their request. This might be an act of generosity, a general interest in the project or the school or even for their own publicity.
